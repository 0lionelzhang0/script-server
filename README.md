# script-server
Script-server provides Web GUI for your scripts and remote execution facility. 

All you need to do, is create link/configuration to your scripts and start the server. Users will be able to access your scripts via web-browser and execute them. 
Everything will run on your machine, so users shouldn't care about setting up an environment or working via ssh.


GUI is very straightforward and easy-to-use for anyone. Example of the user interface:

[conf-server] These features are configurable for the whole server, see [server config page](https://github.com/bugy/script-server/wiki/Server-config) for details

## Setup and run
1. Clone/download the repository
2. Create configurations for your scripts in *conf/runners/* folder (see [script config page](https://github.com/bugy/script-server/wiki/Script-config) for details)
3. Launch server using python3: python launcher.py

By default, server will run on 5000 port, over HTTP protocol

### Server config
All the features listed above and some other minor features can be configured in *conf/conf.json* file. 
It is allowed not to create this file. In this case default values will be used.
See [server config page](https://github.com/bugy/script-server/wiki/Server-config) for details

#### SSL 
If you want server to work over HTTPS, you should specify server key and certificate in server configuration.

## Requirements
### Server-side
Python 3.5+ with following modules:
* Tornado
* six

OS support:
- Linux (main). Tested and working on Debian 8
- Windows (additional). Light testing on Windows 7
- MacOS (additional). Not tested. Most probably some fixes are needed

### Client-side
Any more or less up to date browser with enabled JS

Internet connection is not needed. All the files are loaded from the server.

## Security
Completely no security! Use it only in local network for trusted users. 

## Logging
All web/operating logs are written to the *logs/server.log*
Additionally each script logs are written to separate file in *logs/processes*. File name format is {script\_name}\_{client\_address}\_{date}\_{time}.log. 

## Testing/demo
Script-server has bundled configs/scripts for testing/demo purposes, which are located in testing folder. You can link/copy testing config files to server config files.
